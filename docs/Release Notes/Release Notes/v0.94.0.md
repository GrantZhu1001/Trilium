## üí° Key highlights

*   A [huge amount of work](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/1325) was done by @perfectra1n‚ÄÇto integrate LLMs such as Ollama and ChatGPT into Trilium.
    *   The goal is not to have basic API integration, but to really let the LLM understand the notes that are part of your knowledge base.
    *   For more information, consult the in-app User Guide (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and look for the AI section.
    *   Since this is highly experimental work, the LLM chat functionality might work well or it might have quite a few quirks, please keep this in mind.
*   This release brings significant updates to our libraries:
    *   CKEditor, used by text notes is now updated to the latest version and that brings in new features (see below) and performance improvements.
    *   CodeMirror, used by code notes has been upgraded to a new generation.
    *   Code notes now also support themes, similar to code blocks.
